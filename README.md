# poliespellinglish
Alternative spelling of English based on Poliespo orthography. I will write a detailed guide shortly

## Unicode-friendly
The orthography of Poliespo is not very Unicode-friendly, especially the characters t-with-overlapping-v and p-with-overlapping-w. Hence, I have decided to make them ψ and φ. As one can see, they look kinda like the original, and they're greek letters so many fonts support them
